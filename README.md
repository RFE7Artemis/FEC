Special Operations Group Artemis Tactical Coding Division
OFFICIAL CODE OF CONDUCT:

1) All members of SOG-Artemis-TCD will share equal roles and responsibilites. Each team member will be responsible for their own individual widget, as well as explaining and integrating it into the final MVP.

2) All communications will be relayed through the Artemis slack. Each member will update their corresponding Trello tickets with progress, issues, and updates as needed. Daily meetings on zoom to coordinate our approach and tackle issues before they arise are mandatory.

3) Any decision that impacts more than a single widget will be decided upon as a group following a discussion amongst all members

4) If two team members have opposing theories they will each present their pitch to the third member who will make a final decison. If the third member is unable to come to a conclusion then both ideas will be assigned to a colored snail as chosen by their original pitch founder and the ideas will race 60 seconds to the death.

5) Timely attendence of all stand-ups, meetings, and slack summons' will be expected of all members. Trello updates are expected even at a minimum daily, even if that update is "Took the day off"

6) All voices will be heard in all discussions

7) All disccussions (trello, zoom, slack, etc) will remain container safe. If you ask yourself "Is this container safe?" it isnt. If at anytime a member feels as though they aren't being respected they will be given the space and freedom to air their issues either publicly or privately with the other member to have them addressed.

8) Individual Responsibilites are EVERYONES responsibility
